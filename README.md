# 💳 Credit Score Classification using Ensemble Learning

Classify customers into **Poor**, **Standard**, or **Good** credit score tiers using an ensemble of base learners and rich exploratory data analysis. This project mimics real-world credit scoring using classification techniques.

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- 📦 Built a **StackingClassifier** ensemble using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and Naive Bayes.
- 🧹 Processed **99,516 records** with **28 features**, handling:
  - 7,000+ missing values
  - Outliers using Tukey method
  - 8+ skewed features using log transformation
- 🎯 Achieved:
  - ✅ **Accuracy**: 81.02%
  - ✅ **Precision (weighted)**: 80.98%
  - ✅ **Recall (weighted)**: 81.02%

## 🔍 EDA & Feature Engineering

- Uncovered relationships between income, loan type, delayed payments, and credit score.
- Used bar plots, heatmaps, boxplots, and distribution plots to visualize patterns.
- Applied one-hot encoding and handled missing + inconsistent entries.

---

## 🧠 Model Development

- Evaluated 5+ classifiers and selected **StackingClassifier** for best performance.
- Used `confusion_matrix`, `classification_report`, and macro-averaged metrics.
